``django-axes`` is a very simple way for you to keep track of failed login
attempts, both for the Django admin and for the rest of your site. The name is
sort of a geeky pun, since ``axes`` can be read interpreted as:

* "access", as in monitoring access attempts
* "axes", as in tools you can use hack (generally on wood). In this case,
  however, the "hacking" part of it can be taken a bit further: ``django-axes``
  is intended to help you *stop* people from hacking (popular media
  definition) your website. Hilarious, right? That's what I thought too!
